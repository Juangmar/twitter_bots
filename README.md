## Getting Started

This project has been developed using JavaScript, connecting to the Twitter API and executing using Node.js.

Altough every node module has been 'installed' in every project package, it's recomended to manually install them befor execute the bots.

### Prerequisites

To execute any bot you must create a .json file with the user authentication in the same directory as the .js runnable flie.

The .json file must have the next content:
```javascript
{
	"consumer_key": "----------",
	"consumer_secret": "----------",
	"access_token": "----------",
	"access_token_secret": "----------",
}
```
Where the lines must be replaced with your own cretendial. Those credentials are asociated with your own app, created with a Twitter user via [it's own page](https://apps.twitter.com/)
